# Identify which individuals visiting our clients site are likely to click on her ad.


This repository contains the results and technical aspects  of the Data Science Core IP "A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads. 


### Approach 1: Perform all the relevant data cleaning procedures, carry out a thorough EDA to help answer the above question.


We will find statistics for the data, plot graphs and find what influences a visitor to the site to click on the ad, using this information we will draw conclusions and give recommendations.
